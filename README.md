## Requirements

- Render a Feed (list of posts that includes an image, caption, profile, and like count)
- Use mock data & display mock data posts in a random order. (Create the data and format it on your own).
- Implement client-side routing to switch seamlessly between the Feed view and a User Profile view.
- Render a profile (should be able to click on a profile through feed and view all posts made by the user in a grid format). (The grid does not have to be clickable and accessible, just for aesthetic purposes).
- Have intuitive navigation (the URL reflects the current view).
- Maintain visual consistency and a user-friendly design across all devices.
- Allow users to interact with posts (e.g., clicking the "like" button will turn the heart red.)

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
